# TokenExec 

Just trying to learn how windows access token works and what we can do with it. You can use this tool to in red teaming engagements.

#### What it can do?

1. You need SeImpersonateName Priv.
2. Run as Elevated priv

1. Administrator -> SYSTEM or any user
2. SYSTEM -> basically any user
3. Don't try to get SERVICE account.

If you want SYSTEM then just use winlogon.exe process.
